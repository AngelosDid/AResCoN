# A Researcher is Counting Neurons (AResCoN)
AResCoN is a pipeline developed to perform accurate filtering of cells or nuclei following initial inferences. It uses the output of Cellpose or Stardist and utilizes Fiji to obtain measurements that can be used either for X and Y axis cell filtering or Z-axis cell filtering within a small range of planes.

AResCoN is particularly useful in setups where complete imaging of a slice (hemishpere or brain) is required but it can also be used for isolated regions within a 2D slice. 

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
* AResCoN works optimally with **16-bit** images and has been tested so far only with 20x magnified captures. 8-bit images and lower or higher magnifications are likely to work too.
  
* AResCoN has only be tested with .tif images. Different channels must be tested separately. 
  
* For a complete utilization of its features, it requires images from small multi-stacks (usually comprising up to 10 planes). Due to the wiggly nature of a mounted tissue -as well as the slightly different depth of cells and nuclei populating it- the acquisition of several planes can guarantee at least one crisp capture of each cell-nucleus across many planes. AReScON can filter out Cellpose predictions that are detected over separate planes and correspond to the same observation.

* Please use the Fiji/ImageJ version provided in this repository.
  
* An installation of AutoHotKeysUX is necessary.

## Step 1 (Get independent planes)

Use the 'Stack to Images' ImageJ function and save separately each plane. Images **must end** to _plane1.tif, _plane2.tif and so on. Make sure that each plane includes only a single channel.

## Step 2 (Paste images to corresponding planeN folder)

Create a main Rois_Folder and then create as many planeN_Images subdirectories as the maximum plane that you have. For instance, if brain a consists of 4 planes and brain b of 5, then create 5 planeN subdirectories, where N corresponds to a number from 1 to 5. plane1_images must contain a_plane1.tif and b_plane1.tif , plane2_images must contain a_plane2.tif and b_plane2.tif and so on.

## Step 3 (Convert masks to ROIs)

Run Cellpose inferences and paste each .tif mask output to the respective planeN subdirectory of a main ROIs folder. For instance, if there are 2 multistacks of brain a and brain b, both comprising 5 planes, plane1_ROIs must contain a_plane1.tif and b_plane1.tif, plane2_ROIs must contain a_plane2.tif and b_plane2.tif and so on.

The names of the .tif masks must be **identical** to the names of the initial _planeN.tif images. The provided Cellpose notebook adds an additional _predicted_mask to each mask output name. Remove this additional part from all images. 

If you aren't using planes from small multistacks and are only interested in filtering single shots, place all your .tif output masks inside the plane1_Rois subdirectory of the main ROIs folder.
